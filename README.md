This is my course work for final projects at Carnegie Mellon University
As part of my Data Science for Product Managers course, I had created this using Colab of CMU and used various Python packages to analuse the Yelp dataset as part of my final project work.
The work comprises the solution & ways of working to find the answer for:
Question: How does a business benefit from Yelp to understand or predict whether a user liked a local business or not, based on their review and ratings on Yelp?
Scope covers effective analysis using altair, seaborn and also text process functions
